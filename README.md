# **Real-Time Depression Severity Assessment with Patient Support Chatbot**  

## **Overview**
This project introduces a **web-based intelligent system** designed to assess depression severity using **real-time image analysis**. It leverages **deep learning** to analyze facial characteristics that align with **World Health Organization (WHO) criteria** for depression indicators. The platform is tailored for accessibility, particularly in regions with limited mental health resources, and helps **healthcare providers remotely assess patients.**

## **Key Features**
### **1. User-Friendly Web Interface**
- Built using **Django (backend)** and **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)** for easy accessibility.
- Designed for both **patients and mental health professionals**.

### **2. Real-Time Facial Image Processing**
- Uses a **deep learning-based multi-style transfer model** to analyze facial images.
- Enhances the detection of depression-related **physical symptoms** even on **uneven facial images**.

### **3. Secure Database Management**
- **MySQL integration** ensures secure storage of:
  - User data
  - Appointment records
  - Feedback and other relevant information
- Encrypted data storage and **secure transmission protocols** are used for patient confidentiality.

### **4. Interactive Patient Support Chatbot**
- A chatbot provides **real-time assistance** to patients.
- Helps users navigate the platform, access resources, and **conduct an initial symptom check**.

### **5. Doctor and Patient Interaction**
- Patients can **register**, **book appointments**, and **give feedback**.
- Healthcare providers can **monitor patient status** and **analyze feedback** to improve mental health support.

### **6. Automated Depression Severity Scoring**
- Uses **AI-driven algorithms** to assess depression indicators.
- Provides **objective severity scores** to help healthcare professionals with diagnosis.

### **7. Enhanced Data Security**
- Implements **version control, encrypted database storage**, and **secure communication protocols**.
- Ensures **patient data protection** and **privacy compliance**.
